#Person1#: Have you considered upgrading your system?
#Person2#: Yes, but I'm not sure what exactly I would need.
#Person1#: You could consider adding a painting program to your software. It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising.
#Person2#: That would be a definite bonus.
#Person1#: You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now.
#Person2#: How can we do that?
#Person1#: You'd probably need a faster processor, to begin with. And you also need a more powerful hard disc, more memory and a faster modem. Do you have a CD-ROM drive?
#Person2#: No.
#Person1#: Then you might want to add a CD-ROM drive too, because most new software programs are coming out on Cds.
#Person2#: That sounds great. Thanks.
